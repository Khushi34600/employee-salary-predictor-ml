# üíº Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to analyze employee data and predict salary levels using machine learning techniques. It explores both **regression** (for estimating salary value) and **classification** (for determining if salary is above or below ‚Çπ50K), applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

üìç Developed as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild ‚Äì AI Internship Program (June‚ÄìJuly 2025)** in collaboration with **AICTE** and **Edunet Foundation**.

## üìå Project Objective

- Understand how factors like age, education, occupation, and experience influence salary.
- Predict salary using regression and classification approaches.
- Learn and implement an end-to-end ML pipeline ‚Äî from data loading to model evaluation.
- Build industry-relevant skills in applied machine learning and HR analytics.

## üîç Dataset Overview

The dataset includes employee details such as:

- Age, Education, Occupation, Gender, Industry  
- Workclass, Capital Gain/Loss, Hours per Week  
- Marital Status, Race, Native Country  
- Years of Experience, Final Weight, Location

*Note: Data was cleaned, encoded, and prepared for modeling using standard techniques.*
